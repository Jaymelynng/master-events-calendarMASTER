# ✨ PER-EVENT SPARKLE TOGGLE - FINAL IMPLEMENTATION
## October 6, 2025

---

## 🎉 WHAT YOU GOT

**Individual sparkles on EVERY event card!**

Now you can choose which specific events to see details for - perfect for busy calendar days!

---

## 🎯 HOW IT WORKS

### **Default View (Compact):**
Every event shows:
```
      ✨  ← Click this!
    
   Kids Night Out
     6:30-9:30      ← Short time format
```

- **Title**: Event name (or abbreviation like "KNO")
- **Time**: Short format (6:30-9:30) - no AM/PM
- **Sparkle**: Small circle at top-center
- **Space saved**: ~40% smaller than before!

### **After Clicking Sparkle (Expanded):**
```
      ✨  ← Click again to collapse
    
  Kids Night Out
 6:30 PM - 9:30 PM  ← Full time
       $40          ← Price shows
  [View]  [Copy]    ← Action buttons
```

- **Full details** appear
- **Price** visible
- **Buttons** to View or Copy URL
- **Other events** stay collapsed

---

## ✨ SPARKLE STATES

### **Collapsed (Default):**
- Sparkle has **gray border**
- Slightly **dimmed** (70% opacity)
- Grayscale filter applied
- Tooltip: "Click to expand details"

### **Expanded:**
- Sparkle has **pink border** (your brand color #b48f8f)
- Full brightness (100% opacity)
- Colorful sparkle
- Tooltip: "Click to collapse"

---

## 🎨 SPACE-SAVING TIME FORMAT

**Old format:**
- `6:30 PM - 9:30 PM` (16 characters)

**New compact format:**
- `6:30-9:30` (9 characters)
- **44% shorter!**

**Why this works:**
- Most events are PM (gyms don't do 6 AM!)
- Context makes it obvious
- Saves tons of horizontal space
- More events visible at once

---

## 🌟 DUAL SPARKLE SYSTEM

### **Global Sparkle (Top of Calendar):**
- Click to toggle hover popups ON/OFF
- **When OFF**: Disables hover AND collapses all event sparkles
- **When ON**: Hovers work, individual sparkles clickable
- Good for: "Show me nothing, calendar is too busy"

### **Per-Event Sparkles (On Each Card):**
- Click to expand THAT specific event
- Independent of other events
- Good for: "Show me just these 3 events"

**Together they give you:** Maximum control over your calendar view!

---

## 💡 USE CASES

### **Scenario 1: Super Busy Day**
Day has 8 events, you just need to check 2 specific ones:
1. Click global sparkle OFF (collapses everything)
2. Click individual sparkles on the 2 you care about
3. Only those 2 show details!

### **Scenario 2: Sparse Calendar**
Day has 2-3 events, easy to scan:
1. Leave global sparkle ON (default)
2. Hover for quick previews (old behavior)
3. Or click individual sparkles for sticky details

### **Scenario 3: Reviewing Events**
Need to check prices on all KNO events:
1. Click sparkle on each KNO event
2. All expand at once showing prices
3. Easy comparison
4. Click sparkles again to collapse

---

## 🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### **Files Changed:**
- `EventsDashboard.js` (+90 lines)

### **New State:**
```javascript
const [expandedEvents, setExpandedEvents] = useState(new Set());
```
- Tracks which event IDs are expanded
- Uses Set for O(1) lookup performance
- Persists during session

### **New Functions:**
1. `toggleEventExpansion(eventId, e)` - Expands/collapses specific event
2. `formatTimeShort(timeString)` - Converts to compact time format

### **Modified:**
- Event card rendering (complete rebuild)
- Hover behavior (still works when global ON)
- Global toggle (now also collapses expanded events)

---

## 📋 WHAT'S DIFFERENT

### **Before:**
- Events always showed full details
- Hover = Floating popup
- No way to compact view
- Busy calendars = Overwhelming

### **After:**
- Events compact by default
- Click sparkle = Details appear IN the card
- Hover still works (when global sparkle ON)
- Busy calendars = Clean and scannable
- You choose what to see!

## 🚨 IF SOMETHING SEEMS WRONG

### **"Sparkles aren't showing"**
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- Check browser console for errors

### **"Clicking sparkle does nothing"**
- Make sure global sparkle (top) is ON (bright pink)
- If it's gray/OFF, click it first

### **"I want to collapse everything fast"**
- Click the global sparkle at top (next to Next button)
- All events collapse instantly

### **"Hover isn't working"**
- Check global sparkle - if gray, click to turn ON
- Hover only works when global sparkle is enabled
