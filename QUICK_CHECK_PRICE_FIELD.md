## ⚡ 2-Minute Browser Check

### What You Need:
- Your iClassPro portal open
- 2 minutes

### Steps:

1. **Go to:** `https://app.iclasspro.com/{your-gym}/calendar`

2. **Press F12** (Developer Tools)

3. **Click:** Network tab

4. **Click:** Any event with a price

5. **Look for:** `/camps/####` request (the #### is a number)

6. **Click on it** → Response tab

7. **Look at the JSON** - it will look something like this:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": 2106,
    "name": "Kids Night Out - $45",
    "description": "<p>Join us! Cost is $45 per child.</p>",
    "startDate": "2026-02-15",
    "endDate": "2026-02-15",
    "schedule": [...],
    "hasOpenings": true,
    "minAge": 5,
    "maxAge": 12
  }
}
```

### 🔍 What to Look For:

**Press Ctrl+F (or Cmd+F) and search for:**
- `"price":`
- `"cost":`
- `"fee":`
- `"priceAmount":`

### ✅ If You Find It:

Example:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": 2106,
    "name": "Kids Night Out",
    "price": 45,  // ← FOUND IT!
    ...
  }
}
```

**→ Take a screenshot and share it!**  
**→ I'll update the code immediately to use it!**

### ❌ If You DON'T Find It:

You'll only see prices like:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "name": "Kids Night Out - $45",  // ← Price in text here
    "description": "<p>Cost: $45</p>",  // ← Or here
    // But no "price": 45 field
  }
}
```

**→ This confirms text extraction is the only way**

## 💡 Why This Matters

**If price field EXISTS:**
- ✅ We can extract it directly
- ✅ More reliable
- ✅ No regex needed

**If price field DOESN'T exist:**
- ❌ Must extract from text
- ❌ Need regex patterns
- ✅ But at least we know why
