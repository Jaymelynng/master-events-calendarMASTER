## 🔴 THE 3 CRITICAL BLOCKERS

If you don't fix these, the app **will not work** when deployed:

### 1. Missing Environment Variables
**Problem:** No `.env.local` file exists  
**Impact:** App crashes on startup  
**Fix Time:** 5 minutes  
**How:** Create `.env.local` from `env.example` template

### 2. Missing Public Assets
**Problem:** favicon.png doesn't exist  
**Impact:** Browser console errors, unprofessional  
**Fix Time:** 10 minutes  
**How:** Create or copy any PNG to `public/favicon.png`

### 3. Hardcoded Credentials
**Problem:** Database URLs hardcoded in code  
**Impact:** Security risk, can't use dev/prod environments  
**Fix Time:** 30 minutes  
**How:** Replace hardcoded URLs with environment variables

**Total Critical Fix Time: 45 minutes**

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### Tip 1: Fix One Thing at a Time
Don't try to fix everything at once. Follow the order in CRITICAL_FIXES_TODO.md.

### Tip 2: Test After Each Fix
Verify each fix works before moving to the next one.

### Tip 3: Keep Original Working
Before making changes:
```bash
git commit -m "Before production fixes"
```
So you can revert if needed.

### Tip 4: Use the Documentation
All the answers are in the docs I created. If confused, read the detailed section in PRE_LAUNCH_REVIEW.md.

### Tip 5: Don't Overthink It
These are straightforward fixes. Don't overcomplicate them.
