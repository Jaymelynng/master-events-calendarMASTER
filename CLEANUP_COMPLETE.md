## ⚠️ ONE ITEM REMAINING

**Nested Duplicate Folder:**

- Couldn't delete (files in use/locked)
- **Manual action needed:** Close all apps, then delete this folder

**How to delete it:**
1. Close Cursor/VS Code
2. Close any terminal windows
3. Navigate to project folder
4. Right-click folder → Delete
5. If still locked, restart computer and try again

## 💾 SIZE REDUCTION

**Estimated savings:**
- **Before:** ~1.5 GB (with build folder, duplicates)
- **After:** ~500 MB (node_modules + clean code)
