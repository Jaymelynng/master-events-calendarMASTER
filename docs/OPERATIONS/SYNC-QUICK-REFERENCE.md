## 🎯 THE BASICS

**What is Sync?**  
Sync pulls event information from iClassPro and puts it in our calendar.

**Why do we need it?**  
So our calendar always matches what's in iClassPro without manual data entry.

**How often should I sync?**  
- Monthly: Full sync of all gyms (required)
- Weekly: Quick check of gyms that changed (recommended)

## ❓ COMMON QUESTIONS

### "What does SYNC ALL include?"
Everything! Kids Night Out, Clinics, Open Gym, ALL Camps (summer + school year), and Special Events.

### "What about camps - does it get summer AND school year?"
YES! One click gets all camp types:
- School Year Full Day
- School Year Half Day (if gym offers it)
- Summer Full Day
- Summer Half Day (if gym offers it)

### "Why does one column show a different time?"
That program type might not be offered at that gym. The system only syncs what exists.

### "What if it says 'No Events'?"
That's fine! It just means that gym doesn't have any of that event type scheduled right now. Yellow is OK.

### "Do I need to sync each event type separately?"
NO! Use "SYNC ALL PROGRAMS" to get everything at once. It's faster!

### "What if I only want to update one thing?"
You can still click individual buttons (KNO, CLINIC, etc.) below the SYNC ALL button.
