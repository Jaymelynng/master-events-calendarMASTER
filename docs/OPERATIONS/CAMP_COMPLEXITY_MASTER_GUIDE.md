# üèïÔ∏è CAMP COMPLEXITY MASTER GUIDE
## Understanding How Different Gyms Structure Camp Data

**Created:** October 17, 2025  
**Purpose:** Permanent reference for camp data structure variations across all 10 gyms  
**Critical:** Read this BEFORE making ANY changes to camp import or display logic

---

## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (READ THIS FIRST)

### **The Core Problem:**
**6 out of 10 gyms** create separate iClassPro event listings for each camp option (Gymnastics vs Ninja, Full Day vs Half Day), resulting in 2-4 calendar events appearing for the SAME camp on the SAME dates.

### **Worst Case Example - Estrella Gymnastics:**
"Spring Break Camp" appears as **FOUR separate events**:
1. Girls Gymnastics Camp Full Day (9AM-3PM)
2. Girls Gymnastics Camp Half Day (9AM-12PM)  
3. Ninja Warrior Camp Full Day (9AM-3PM)
4. Ninja Warrior Camp Half Day (9AM-12PM)

**Same dates, same camp theme, but 4x the vertical space on calendar.**

### **The Affected Gyms:**
- **EST** (Estrella): 4 events per camp (2 activities √ó 2 durations)
- **CPF** (Pflugerville): 2 events per camp (Full + Half Day)
- **HGA** (Houston): 2 events per camp (Gym + Ninja)
- **OAS** (Oasis): 2 events per camp (Gym + Ninja)
- **SGT** (Scottsdale): 2 events per camp (Gym + Ninja)
- **TIG** (Tigar): 2 events per camp (Gym + Ninja)

### **What We Need:**
Display-only consolidation that:
1. Groups related camp options into ONE calendar card
2. Preserves ALL unique registration URLs
3. Shows options in hover/click popup
4. Reduces visual clutter by 50-75%

### **What We Can't Change:**
- Database structure (each option needs its own record)
- F12 import process (imports exactly what iClassPro provides)
- Registration URLs (each is unique and required)

### **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: THIS DATA CAN CHANGE AT ANY TIME**
**This document reflects camp structures as of October 17, 2025, but gyms can change their offerings at any time:**
- A gym offering only Full Day camps today might add Half Day tomorrow
- A gym with Gym+Ninja options might drop Ninja next season
- New gyms might be added with completely different structures
- Camp pricing, titles, and patterns can change month-to-month

**Any consolidation solution MUST be flexible enough to handle:**
- Gyms changing from 1 option to 4 options (or vice versa)
- New activity types appearing (Tumbling, Cheer, Dance camps)
- New duration types (Afternoon camps, Extended day, etc.)
- Completely new gyms with unknown patterns

**Don't hard-code anything based on this snapshot. Build detection logic that adapts to whatever the data contains.**

---

## üö® WHY THIS DOCUMENT EXISTS

**The Problem:** Camps are displayed and structured completely differently across gyms, creating massive complexity in how we import, store, and display them.

**Jayme's Frustration:** This has been explained multiple times, but without documentation, every new conversation starts from zero. This document ensures ANYONE (AI or human) can understand the full complexity without repeated explanations.

---

## üìä THE CORE COMPLEXITY: TWO DIFFERENT DATA STRUCTURES

### **Method 1: Single Event ID for Entire Camp Week (MAJORITY)**
**Used By:** Most gyms (HGA, RBA, RBK, EST, OAS, SGT, TIG, CRR, CPF)

**How It Works:**
- iClassPro shows ONE event with ONE event ID for the entire camp week
- Example: "Fall Break Camp | Oct 13-17" = event ID 1234
- Timeline view shows a continuous block spanning multiple days
- **Single F12 import = 1 database record = displays across all camp days**

**Database Structure:**
```json
{
  "id": 1234,
  "title": "Fall Break Camp | Gymnastics | Oct 13-17",
  "date": "2025-10-13",
  "start_date": "2025-10-13",
  "end_date": "2025-10-17",
  "event_url": "https://portal.iclasspro.com/gymslug/camp-details/1234"
}
```

**Display Result:** ONE event card spans Monday-Friday on calendar

---

### **Method 2: Individual Event ID Per Day (CAPITAL CEDAR PARK)**
**Used By:** Capital Gymnastics Cedar Park (CCP) - possibly others

**How It Works:**
- iClassPro shows SEPARATE events for EACH DAY of the camp
- Example: "Fall Break Camp | Oct 13-17" has 5 DIFFERENT event IDs:
  - Monday Oct 13 = event ID 5001
  - Tuesday Oct 14 = event ID 5002
  - Wednesday Oct 15 = event ID 5003
  - Thursday Oct 16 = event ID 5004
  - Friday Oct 17 = event ID 5005
- **Single F12 import = 5 database records = 5 separate event cards**

**Database Structure:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": 5001,
    "title": "Fall Break Camp | Gymnastics | Oct 13-17",
    "date": "2025-10-13",
    "event_url": ".../camp-details/5001"
  },
  {
    "id": 5002,
    "title": "Fall Break Camp | Gymnastics | Oct 13-17",
    "date": "2025-10-14",
    "event_url": ".../camp-details/5002"
  },
  // ... 3 more records
]
```

**Display Result:** 5 SEPARATE event cards, one per day

---

## üéØ CAMP DURATION VARIATIONS

### **Single Day Camps**
- Duration: 1 day only
- Examples: "Kids Night Out", some special event camps
- Event IDs: 1 (Method 1) or 1 (Method 2 - same result)

### **3-Day Camps**
- Duration: 3 consecutive days
- Examples: Holiday weekend camps
- Event IDs: 1 (Method 1) or 3 (Method 2)

### **5-Day School Year Camps**
- Duration: Full week (Monday-Friday)
- Examples: Fall Break, Spring Break camps
- Event IDs: 1 (Method 1) or 5 (Method 2)

### **Holiday/Break Camps**
- Duration: Varies (3-10+ days)
- Examples: Winter Break, Summer camps
- Event IDs: 1 (Method 1) or 1-per-day (Method 2)

---

## üîÄ OPTION VARIATIONS: THE MULTIPLICATION FACTOR

### **Option Type 1: Activity Type (Gymnastics vs Ninja)**
**Gyms That Offer:** Multiple (CCP, CPF, CRR, others)

**What This Means:**
- SAME camp, SAME dates, DIFFERENT activity focus
- Creates SEPARATE event IDs in iClassPro
- Example:
  - "Fall Break Camp | Gymnastics | Oct 13-17" = ID 1234
  - "Fall Break Camp | Ninja | Oct 13-17" = ID 1235

**Multiplication Factor:**
- Method 1 gym: 1 week = 2 events (Gymnastics + Ninja)
- Method 2 gym (CCP): 1 week = 10 events (5 days √ó 2 activities)

---

### **Option Type 2: Duration (Full Day vs Half Day)**
**Gyms That Offer:** Estrella (EST), Pflugerville (CPF), others

**What This Means:**
- SAME camp, SAME dates, DIFFERENT time duration
- Creates SEPARATE event IDs in iClassPro
- Example:
  - "Fall Break Camp | Full Day | Oct 13-17" = ID 1234
  - "Fall Break Camp | Half Day | Oct 13-17" = ID 1236

**Time Differences:**
- Full Day: 9:00 AM - 3:00 PM
- Half Day: 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM OR 12:00 PM - 3:00 PM

**Multiplication Factor:**
- Method 1 gym: 1 week = 2 events (Full + Half)
- Method 2 gym (CCP): 1 week = 10 events (5 days √ó 2 durations)

---

### **Option Type 3: COMBINED (Activity + Duration)**
**Gyms That Offer:** Multiple gyms

**The Worst Case Scenario:**
- Gymnastics Full Day
- Gymnastics Half Day
- Ninja Full Day
- Ninja Half Day

**Event Count:**
- Method 1 gym: 1 week = 4 events
- Method 2 gym (CCP): 1 week = 20 events (5 days √ó 4 options)

## üìã ACTUAL DATA EXAMPLES FROM SUPABASE

### **Example 1: Simple Camp (1 option, Method 1)**
```
Title: "Fall Break Camp | Oct 13-17"
Dates: Oct 13-17
Event IDs: 1
Calendar Display: 1 event card spanning 5 days
```

### **Example 2: Gymnastics + Ninja (Method 1)**
```
Title Option 1: "Fall Break Camp | Gymnastics | Oct 13-17"
Title Option 2: "Fall Break Camp | Ninja | Oct 13-17"
Dates: Oct 13-17
Event IDs: 2 (one per activity)
Calendar Display: 2 event cards, each spanning 5 days
PROBLEM: Takes 2x vertical space on every day
```

### **Example 3: Full Day + Half Day (Method 1)**
```
Title Option 1: "Fall Break Camp | Full Day | Oct 13-17"
Title Option 2: "Fall Break Camp | Half Day | Oct 13-17"
Dates: Oct 13-17
Event IDs: 2 (one per duration)
Calendar Display: 2 event cards, each spanning 5 days
PROBLEM: Takes 2x vertical space on every day
```

### **Example 4: ALL COMBINATIONS (Method 1)**
```
1. "Fall Break Camp | Gymnastics Full Day | Oct 13-17"
2. "Fall Break Camp | Gymnastics Half Day | Oct 13-17"
3. "Fall Break Camp | Ninja Full Day | Oct 13-17"
4. "Fall Break Camp | Ninja Half Day | Oct 13-17"
Dates: Oct 13-17
Event IDs: 4
Calendar Display: 4 event cards, each spanning 5 days
PROBLEM: Takes 4x vertical space on EVERY DAY
```

### **Example 5: Cedar Park Method (Method 2 + Options)**
```
Fall Break Camp with Gymnastics + Ninja options at CCP:
- 5 days √ó 2 activities = 10 separate event IDs
- Each day shows 2 event cards (Gymnastics + Ninja)
- Each card has unique registration URL
Calendar Display: 10 total event cards across 5 days
PROBLEM: Visual clutter, confusing for managers
```

## üìä CRITICAL SUMMARY: THE ACTUAL COMPLEXITY

Based on REAL data from iClassPro (pasted October 17, 2025), here's what we're actually dealing with:

### **Gyms That Need Consolidation (Display Problem):**
1. **EST** (Estrella) - 2 activities √ó 2 durations = 4 events per camp ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è WORST
2. **CPF** (Pflugerville) - Full Day + Half Day = 2 events per camp ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è
3. **HGA** (Houston) - Gymnastics + Ninja = 2 events per camp ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è
4. **OAS** (Oasis) - Girls Gym + Co-ed Ninja = 2 events per camp ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è
5. **SGT** (Scottsdale) - Girls Gym + Parkour/Ninja = 2 events per camp ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è
6. **TIG** (Tigar) - Girls Gym + COED Ninja = 2 events per camp ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

### **Gyms That DON'T Need Consolidation (No Problem):**
1. **CRR** (Round Rock) - Single event per camp ‚úÖ
2. **RBA** (Atascocita) - Combines Gym/Ninja in one registration ‚úÖ

### **Special Case:**
- **CCP** (Cedar Park) - Uses per-day event IDs (Method 2) but NO Gym/Ninja split, so consolidation would group by camp name across days

### **The Real Problem:**
**6 out of 10 gyms** show EVERY camp as MULTIPLE events:
- **Estrella:** Spring Break = 4 calendar events (Gym Full, Gym Half, Ninja Full, Ninja Half)
- **Pflugerville:** Spring Break = 2 calendar events (Full Day, Half Day)
- **Houston, Oasis, Scottsdale, Tigar:** Spring Break = 2 calendar events each (Gymnastics, Ninja)
- **Result:** Takes up 2-4x vertical space on EVERY camp day

### **The Solution Needed:**
Group events by:
- Same gym
- Same camp name/theme (before "Gymnastics" or "Ninja" keyword)
- Same date range
- Show as ONE card with hover revealing both registration options

## üîç HOW TO IDENTIFY CAMP OPTIONS

### **Pattern Analysis from F12 Data:**

#### **Activity Options (Gymnastics vs Ninja):**
Look for titles with:
- `| Gymnastics |` or `| Gym |` or `| Gymnastics`
- `| Ninja |` or `| Ninja`

#### **Duration Options (Full vs Half Day):**
Look for titles with:
- `| Full Day |` or `Full Day` or `9:00 AM - 3:00 PM`
- `| Half Day |` or `Half Day` or `9:00 AM - 12:00 PM`

#### **Combined Options:**
- `| Gymnastics Full Day |`
- `| Gymnastics Half Day |`
- `| Ninja Full Day |`
- `| Ninja Half Day |`

### **Grouping Logic:**
Events should group if they share:
1. ‚úÖ Same gym_id
2. ‚úÖ Same base camp name (before first `|` or before "Gymnastics"/"Ninja")
3. ‚úÖ Same date range (start_date to end_date)
4. ‚úÖ Type = "CAMP"

**Base Camp Name Extraction Examples:**
```
"Fall Break Camp | Gymnastics | Oct 13-17" ‚Üí "Fall Break Camp"
"Parkour & Ninja Fall Break Camp 2025 | Gymnastics Full Day" ‚Üí "Parkour & Ninja Fall Break Camp 2025"
"Winter Wonderland Camp | Half Day" ‚Üí "Winter Wonderland Camp"
```

## üìÅ WHERE THE DATA COMES FROM

### **F12 Import Process:**

**üìñ For complete F12 import documentation, see:** [F12-IMPORT-GUIDE.md](./F12-IMPORT-GUIDE.md)

**Quick Overview:**
1. User opens gym's camp page (e.g., `portal.iclasspro.com/capgymavery/camps/14`)
2. Press F12 ‚Üí Network tab ‚Üí Refresh page
3. Find API call to iClassPro (usually `/camps/[type_id]`)
4. Right-click ‚Üí Copy Response
5. Paste into Master Events app

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** The F12 import process is working CORRECTLY. Each event from iClassPro (Gym Full, Gym Half, Ninja Full, Ninja Half) has a unique event ID and registration URL, so they MUST be imported as separate database records. The "problem" this document addresses is purely about how we DISPLAY these events on the calendar, not how we import them.

### **Raw JSON Structure:**
```json
{
  "totalRecords": 4,
  "campTypeName": "SCHOOL YEAR CAMP - FULL DAY",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1234,
      "name": "Fall Break Camp | Gymnastics Full Day | Ages 5+ | October 13th-17th",
      "startDate": "2025-10-13",
      "endDate": "2025-10-17",
      "schedule": [
        {
          "startTime": "9:00 AM",
          "endTime": "3:00 PM"
        }
      ],
      "minAge": 5,
      "maxAge": 99,
      "hasOpenings": true
    },
    {
      "id": 1235,
      "name": "Fall Break Camp | Ninja Full Day | Ages 5+ | October 13th-17th",
      "startDate": "2025-10-13",
      "endDate": "2025-10-17",
      "schedule": [
        {
          "startTime": "9:00 AM",
          "endTime": "3:00 PM"
        }
      ],
      "minAge": 5,
      "maxAge": 99,
      "hasOpenings": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### **After Import to Database:**
Each item in `data` array becomes a separate database record:
```sql
INSERT INTO events (gym_id, title, date, start_date, end_date, time, type, event_url)
VALUES 
('CCP', 'Fall Break Camp | Gymnastics Full Day | Ages 5+ | October 13th-17th', '2025-10-13', '2025-10-13', '2025-10-17', '9:00 AM - 3:00 PM', 'CAMP', 'https://portal.iclasspro.com/capgymavery/camp-details/1234'),
('CCP', 'Fall Break Camp | Ninja Full Day | Ages 5+ | October 13th-17th', '2025-10-13', '2025-10-13', '2025-10-17', '9:00 AM - 3:00 PM', 'CAMP', 'https://portal.iclasspro.com/capgymavery/camp-details/1235');
```

**Each has DIFFERENT `event_url` pointing to DIFFERENT iClassPro registration pages.**

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ANY SOLUTION

### **MUST PRESERVE:**
1. ‚úÖ **All registration URLs** - Every event_url must remain accessible
2. ‚úÖ **Database integrity** - No changes to how we import or store data
3. ‚úÖ **Unique event IDs** - Each iClassPro event ID is unique and must be preserved
4. ‚úÖ **Individual event details** - Price, time, age ranges per option

### **MUST AVOID:**
1. ‚ùå **Losing registration links** - Parents need direct access to each option
2. ‚ùå **Breaking F12 import** - Current import process works and is fast
3. ‚ùå **Data consolidation in database** - Would break referential integrity
4. ‚ùå **Assuming patterns** - Every gym structures data differently

### **ACCEPTABLE CHANGES:**
1. ‚úÖ **Display-only grouping** - Combine at UI render time, not in database
2. ‚úÖ **Smart hover popups** - Show multiple registration links when hovering
3. ‚úÖ **Visual consolidation** - One card on calendar with "X options" badge
4. ‚úÖ **Expandable details** - Click/hover to see all available options

---

## üìù QUESTIONS TO ASK BEFORE MAKING CHANGES

If you're an AI or developer about to work on camp display logic, ASK THESE FIRST:

### **1. Data Source Questions:**
- [ ] Have you reviewed actual F12 data from at least 3 different gyms?
- [ ] Do you understand the difference between Method 1 and Method 2 gyms?
- [ ] Have you checked the current database to see real camp data structure?

### **2. Grouping Logic Questions:**
- [ ] How will you identify which events belong to the same camp?
- [ ] What happens if a camp has NO pipe delimiter (`|`) in the title?
- [ ] What if two completely different camps happen the same week?
- [ ] How will you handle Cedar Park's per-day event IDs?

### **3. Display Questions:**
- [ ] How will you show 4+ options in a hover popup without it being overwhelming?
- [ ] What happens on mobile where hover doesn't work?
- [ ] How will users know there are multiple options before hovering?
- [ ] Will consolidated cards be visually distinct from regular camps?

### **4. URL Preservation Questions:**
- [ ] Can you guarantee EVERY event_url remains clickable?
- [ ] What if someone bookmarks or shares a specific option's URL?
- [ ] How will the "View Details" button know which URL to use?
- [ ] Will social sharing work correctly?

### **5. Edge Case Questions:**
- [ ] What if one option is full but others have openings?
- [ ] What if options have different prices?
- [ ] What if options have different age ranges?
- [ ] What about camps that span different months?

---

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR A SOLUTION

A proper camp consolidation solution MUST:

1. ‚úÖ **Reduce visual clutter** by showing 1 card instead of 4+ cards
2. ‚úÖ **Preserve all functionality** - Every registration link accessible
3. ‚úÖ **Handle all gym variations** - Method 1, Method 2, all option types
4. ‚úÖ **Work on mobile** - Touch-friendly, no hover-only interactions
5. ‚úÖ **Be obvious to users** - Clear indication of multiple options
6. ‚úÖ **Maintain data integrity** - No database schema changes
7. ‚úÖ **Scale to edge cases** - 6+ options, cross-month camps, etc.

## üîÑ UPDATE HISTORY & VERSION TRACKING

### **Version 1.0 - October 17, 2025**
- Initial creation with complete gym-by-gym analysis
- Based on real iClassPro data pasted from live portals
- Verified: CCP, CPF, CRR, EST, HGA, OAS, RBA, SGT, TIG
- Not verified: RBK (needs data)

### **When to Update This Document:**

‚úÖ **Update when:**
- A gym adds/removes camp options (Full/Half Day, Gym/Ninja)
- A gym changes their event structure (Method 1 ‚Üî Method 2)
- New gyms are added to the system
- Event title patterns change significantly
- New activity types appear (Tumbling, Cheer, etc.)

üì∏ **How to Update:**
1. Go to gym's iClassPro camp page
2. Copy-paste the actual listing text (like Jayme did Oct 17, 2025)
3. Update the gym's section with new patterns
4. Add version note with date and what changed
5. Update "Gyms That Need Consolidation" summary if needed

‚ö†Ô∏è **Don't Update for:**
- Minor title wording changes
