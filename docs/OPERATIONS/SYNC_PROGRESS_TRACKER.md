# 📊 SYNC PROGRESS TRACKER - Complete Guide
## Never Lose Track of What You've Synced

**Last Updated:** November 26, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Fully Implemented

---

## 🎯 WHAT IS THE SYNC PROGRESS TRACKER?

The Sync Progress Tracker is a **visual grid** that shows you:
- Which gyms you've synced
- Which event types you've synced
- When you last synced each combination
- Whether events were found or not

**It solves this problem:** "Wait, did I already sync Oasis Kids Night Out? Where did I leave off?"

## 🎨 COLOR CODING

| Color | Meaning | What to Do |
|-------|---------|------------|
| 🟢 **Green** | Synced and events were found | Nothing - you're good! |
| 🟡 **Yellow** | Synced but no events scheduled | Nothing - gym just doesn't have that event type right now |
| 🔴 **Red/Pink** | Never synced OR needs re-sync | Click to sync this gym/program |

---

## ⏰ TIME DISPLAY

The tracker shows how long ago you synced:

| Display | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `Just now` | Less than 1 minute ago |
| `1m ago` | 1 minute ago |
| `5m ago` | 5 minutes ago |
| `2h ago` | 2 hours ago |
| `1d ago` | 1 day ago |
| `X Need` | Never synced |

---

## 📍 WHERE TO FIND IT

1. Open the **Admin Portal** (Shift + Click 🪄)
2. Click **"⚡ Automated Sync"**
3. The progress tracker is at the **TOP of the sync modal**
4. Click **[Collapse]** to hide it, **[Expand]** to show it

---

## 🔄 HOW IT WORKS

### When You Sync:
1. You click a gym and event type
2. System collects events from iClassPro
3. **Sync log is updated** with:
   - Gym ID
   - Event type
   - Timestamp
   - Number of events found
4. Progress tracker refreshes to show new status

### When You Import:
1. After successful import
2. **Sync log is updated** with:
   - Number of events imported
3. Grid reflects the completed sync

---

## 🗄️ DATABASE STRUCTURE

The sync progress is stored in a Supabase table called `sync_log`.

### Table: `sync_log`

| Column | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `id` | UUID | Unique identifier |
| `gym_id` | TEXT | Which gym (CCP, EST, etc.) |
| `event_type` | TEXT | Which type (KIDS NIGHT OUT, CLINIC, etc.) |
| `last_synced` | TIMESTAMP | When the sync happened |
| `events_found` | INTEGER | How many events were collected |
| `events_imported` | INTEGER | How many were actually imported |

### Unique Constraint
Each gym + event_type combination can only have ONE row. When you sync again, it **updates** the existing row instead of creating a new one.

```sql
UNIQUE(gym_id, event_type)
```

---

## 🛠️ HOW TO CREATE THE TABLE

If the `sync_log` table doesn't exist, run this SQL in Supabase:

```sql
CREATE TABLE sync_log (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  gym_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  event_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  last_synced TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  events_found INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  events_imported INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  UNIQUE(gym_id, event_type)
);

-- Allow the app to read/write
GRANT ALL ON sync_log TO anon, authenticated;
```

## 🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS (For AI/Developers)

### Frontend Code Location
**File:** `src/components/EventsDashboard/SyncModal.js`

### API Functions
**File:** `src/lib/api.js`

```javascript
export const syncLogApi = {
  // Get all sync records
  async getSyncLog() {
    const { data, error } = await supabase
      .from('sync_log')
      .select('*');
    return data;
  },
  
  // Update or create sync record
  async upsertSyncLog(gymId, eventType, eventsFound, eventsImported) {
    const { data, error } = await supabase
      .from('sync_log')
      .upsert(
        { 
          gym_id: gymId, 
          event_type: eventType, 
          last_synced: new Date().toISOString(), 
          events_found: eventsFound, 
          events_imported: eventsImported 
        },
        { onConflict: 'gym_id,event_type' }  // Update if exists
      );
    return data;
  }
};
```

### When Sync Log Updates

1. **After collecting events** (even if 0 found):
```javascript
await syncLogApi.upsertSyncLog(gymId, eventType, eventsFound, 0);
```

2. **After importing events**:
```javascript
await syncLogApi.upsertSyncLog(gymId, eventType, eventsFound, eventsImported);
```

## 📋 WORKFLOW EXAMPLE

### Scenario: Monthly Sync of All Gyms

**Step 1:** Open Automated Sync modal
**Step 2:** Look at progress tracker - see what needs syncing (red cells)
**Step 3:** Start with first gym that needs sync
**Step 4:** Sync each event type for that gym
**Step 5:** Progress tracker updates in real-time as you go
**Step 6:** Move to next gym
**Step 7:** When all cells are green/yellow, you're done!

### If You Get Interrupted:
- Come back later
- Open the progress tracker
- See exactly where you left off (green = done, red = still need)
- Continue from there

---

## ❓ FAQ

### **Q: Why do some cells show yellow instead of green?**
A: Yellow means the gym doesn't have any events of that type scheduled right now. This is normal - not every gym has every event type every month.

### **Q: How often should I sync?**
A: Weekly is good. Daily if you want to catch changes quickly. The tracker helps you see what's stale.

### **Q: Can I see historical sync data?**
A: Currently, the table only stores the LAST sync for each gym/type. Historical tracking could be added in the future.

### **Q: What if I sync the same thing twice?**
A: No problem! The system compares events and only imports what's actually new or changed. The sync log just updates the timestamp.

### **Q: Does the tracker persist if I close the modal?**
A: Yes! The data is stored in Supabase. When you reopen the modal, it fetches the latest sync log.

## 🚀 FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

Possible enhancements for the future:

1. **Stale indicator** - Turn yellow/red if sync is older than X days
2. **One-click "Sync All"** - Sync every gym/type automatically
3. **Email notifications** - Alert when sync hasn't happened in a while
4. **Historical tracking** - Keep history of all syncs, not just the latest
