> ⚠️ STALE (checked 2026-10-13): the 3-tier access (Shift+Click wand, `*` + PIN) still matches the code, but the tab list is out of date — the Admin Dashboard now has 7 tabs: 🚨 Errors, 🗂️ Buckets, 📏 Gym Rules, ✉️ Contacts, 📜 Change History, 📅 Future Plans, ⚡ Quick Actions (`AdminDashboard.js:541-549`). Audit & Review, Pricing (`AdminPricing.js`) and their sub-files are deleted; there are no price rules. The PIN comes from `REACT_APP_ADMIN_PIN` with `1426` as the code fallback (`AdminDashboard.js:510`) — a client-side PIN anyone can read in the page source. Current: `CLAUDE.md` › Admin Access + Admin Dashboard Tabs.

# 🔐 ADMIN MODE - Complete Guide
## Three-Tier Access System + Full-Page Admin Dashboard

**Last Updated:** February 2, 2026
**Status:** ✅ Fully Implemented
**Files:** `src/components/AdminDashboard/AdminDashboard.js` + sub-components

---

## 🎯 OVERVIEW

The Master Events Calendar has a **hidden admin system** with three levels of access. This keeps the main calendar clean for regular users while giving you (Jayme) full control.

---

## 👥 THE THREE TIERS

### 📺 **Level 1: Normal View (Everyone)**

**Who:** Your boss, coworkers, anyone with the link  
**How to access:** Just visit the calendar URL  
**What they see:**
- ✅ Full calendar with all events
- ✅ Event details when clicking events
- ✅ Stats table showing events per gym
- ✅ Filter by gym, event type, search
- ❌ No admin features
- ❌ No import tools
- ❌ No database links

**This is the "public" view - clean and professional.**

---

### 🪄 **Level 2: Admin View (Jayme)**

**Who:** You (Jayme)
**How to access:** **Shift+Click** the 🪄 wand icon in the stats table header
**What you see:**

A **full-page Admin Dashboard** replaces the calendar with **5 tabs**:

- ✅ **Audit & Review** (default tab) - See ALL validation errors across selected gyms, filter by category (DATA/FORMAT), month (synced with calendar view), program type, status (Active/Resolved). Dismiss errors or create permanent rules.
- ✅ **Pricing** - Event pricing (Clinic, KNO, Open Gym) and Camp pricing. Base expected prices for validation. View, add, or delete.
- ✅ **Gym Rules** - View, add, delete per-gym validation rules (price, time, program_synonym). Rules grouped by gym.
- ✅ **Change History** - Shows CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE audit entries from `event_audit_log`. Filter by gym and action type, with pagination and CSV export.
- ✅ **Quick Actions** - Automated Sync and JSON Import buttons. Super Admin tools require PIN.
- ✅ **"Back to Calendar"** button returns to normal view

**Where is the wand?**
- In the stats table header row, there's a small 🪄 icon
- **Shift+Click** it to open the Admin Dashboard
- Regular click does nothing — protects against accidental access

---

### 🔒 **Level 3: Super Admin (Jayme Only)**

**Who:** Only you
**How to access:** Inside the Admin Dashboard:
1. Click the 🔐 lock icon (top right of header), OR press the `*` key
2. Enter PIN: `1426`
3. Click "Unlock"

**What you see:**

Everything from Level 2, PLUS (in the Quick Actions tab):
- ✅ **Supabase Dashboard Link** - Direct access to database editor
- ✅ **Railway Dashboard Link** - Direct access to API server
- ✅ **Audit History** - See all changes made to events
- ✅ **Automated Sync** button - Opens the SyncModal
- ✅ **JSON Import** button - Opens the BulkImportModal

**Why is this hidden?**
- These links give FULL access to your infrastructure
- If someone got these links, they could modify or delete everything
- Only YOU should ever access these

---

## 🎮 HOW TO USE EACH LEVEL

### Accessing Level 2 (Admin Dashboard)

```
Step 1: Go to your calendar
Step 2: Find the 🪄 wand icon in the stats table header
Step 3: Hold Shift and click the wand
Step 4: Full-page Admin Dashboard opens (replaces calendar)
Step 5: Use tabs: Audit & Review | Pricing | Gym Rules | Change History | Quick Actions
Step 6: Click "Back to Calendar" when done
```

---

### Accessing Level 3 (Super Admin)

```
Step 1: Open Admin Dashboard (Shift+Click 🪄 wand)
Step 2: Look for the 🔐 lock icon (top right of the dashboard header)
Step 3: Either:
   - Click the 🔐 lock icon, OR
   - Press: * (asterisk key)
Step 4: Enter PIN: 1426 in the popup
Step 5: Click "Unlock"
Step 6: Super Admin badge appears, Quick Actions tab unlocks all tools
```

**The PIN is:** `1426`

**Why this PIN?**
- You chose it! It's stored in the code, not in a database
- Easy for you to remember, impossible for others to guess
- Can be changed in the code if needed

**To exit Super Admin mode:**
- Click "Exit Super Admin" button, OR
- Press `*` key again, OR

## 🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS (For AI/Developers)

### Code Location
**Main file:** `src/components/AdminDashboard/AdminDashboard.js`
**Sub-components:**
- `AdminAuditReview.js` — Audit & Review tab
- `AdminAuditFilters.js` — Filter bar (gym checkboxes, month, program, status, category)
- `AdminAuditErrorCard.js` — Single event error card
- `AdminGymRules.js` — Gym Rules tab
- `AdminQuickActions.js` — Quick Actions tab

### How Level 2 Access Works
```javascript
// In EventsDashboard.js — state-based view swap (no router)
if (showAdminPortal) {
  return <AdminDashboard gyms={gyms} onClose={() => setShowAdminPortal(false)} ... />;
}
// Normal calendar renders below...
```

The trigger is a Shift+Click on the 🪄 wand icon in the stats table header. This sets `showAdminPortal = true`, causing the full-page dashboard to render instead of the calendar.

### How Level 3 Access Works
```javascript
// In AdminDashboard.js
const [superAdminMode, setSuperAdminMode] = useState(false);
const SUPER_ADMIN_PIN = process.env.REACT_APP_ADMIN_PIN || '1426';

// * key shows PIN modal (or toggles off if already in super admin)
// Ignores keypresses in INPUT/TEXTAREA/SELECT elements
useEffect(() => {
  const handleKeyDown = (e) => {
    if (e.target.tagName === 'INPUT' || e.target.tagName === 'TEXTAREA' || e.target.tagName === 'SELECT') return;
    if (e.key === '*') {
      if (superAdminMode) setSuperAdminMode(false);
      else { setShowPinModal(true); setPinInput(''); }
    }
  };
  window.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
}, [superAdminMode]);
```

### State Management
- `superAdminMode` resets to `false` when dashboard closes
- User must re-enter PIN each time they open the admin dashboard
- Press `*` again to exit Super Admin mode
- This is intentional for security

### Admin Dashboard Tabs
| Tab | Component | When Visible |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| Audit & Review | `AdminAuditReview` | Always (default tab) |
| Pricing | `AdminPricing` | Always |
| Gym Rules | `AdminGymRules` | Always |
| Change History | `AdminChangeHistory` | Always (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE audit log with gym/action filters, pagination, CSV export) |
| Quick Actions | `AdminQuickActions` | Always (Super Admin tools hidden behind PIN) |

### Super Admin Tools URLs
```javascript
// Supabase Dashboard
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/xftiwouxpefchwoxxgpf/editor

// Railway Dashboard
https://railway.app/dashboard
```

---

## ❓ FAQ

### **Q: Can I change the PIN?**
A: Yes! Set `REACT_APP_ADMIN_PIN` in your Vercel environment variables, or edit `AdminDashboard.js` directly. Default is `1426`.

### **Q: What if I forget the PIN?**
A: It's `1426`. Also, you can press `*` instead. And it's in this document!

### **Q: Can other people access Level 2?**
A: Yes, the Admin button is visible. But they won't know what to do with it unless they know about the import tools.

### **Q: Is the PIN stored securely?**
A: It's in the JavaScript code, which technically anyone could find if they looked at the source. For a truly secure system, you'd use real authentication. But for your use case (hiding admin from casual users), this is fine.

### **Q: Why not just use a login system?**
A: Because this is faster and simpler for a single-user admin scenario. Real authentication would add complexity you don't need right now.

## 🚨 SECURITY NOTES

1. **Super Admin links** give full database/server access - protect them
2. **If you ever need to revoke Super Admin access**, change the PIN in the code and redeploy
3. The Admin button is visible but harmless - only the Super Admin tools are sensitive

---

## ⚠️ NOT SEEING THE PRICING TAB OR LATEST CHANGES?

**If you don't see the Pricing tab or recent UI updates:**

1. **Local dev:** Run `npm start` and do a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R).
2. **Deployed (Vercel):** Push your changes to git and wait for Vercel to redeploy. The live site only updates after a new deployment.
3. **Cache:** Clear your browser cache or try an incognito/private window.

---

## 📜 ACCESS METHOD

### Shift+Click Wand (Primary Method)
The 🪄 wand icon in the stats table header opens the full-page Admin Dashboard when **Shift+Clicked**.

**Location:** Stats table, in the header row
**How it works:** Shift+Click the small wand icon
**What happens:** Calendar view is replaced with full-page Admin Dashboard
**Return:** Click "Back to Calendar" button in the dashboard header
