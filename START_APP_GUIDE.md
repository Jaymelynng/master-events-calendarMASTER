## üì± ACCESSING FROM OTHER DEVICES

Want to open the calendar on your phone/tablet while connected to the same WiFi?

1. In the terminal, look for a line that says:
   ```
   On Your Network: http://192.168.X.X:3000
   ```
2. Type that address into your phone's browser
3. The calendar will work on any device!

## üéØ WHAT THOSE TERMINAL MESSAGES MEAN

When you start the app, you'll see messages like:

**‚úÖ GOOD MESSAGES (Everything's Fine):**
- `"Compiled successfully!"`
- `"webpack compiled"`
- `"Local: http://localhost:3000"`
- These mean: **App is working!**

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING MESSAGES (Annoying but Harmless):**
- Yellow text warnings
- `"Deprecation warning"`
- These mean: **Ignore these, app still works**

**‚ùå BAD MESSAGES (Something's Wrong):**
- Red text with "ERROR"
- `"Failed to compile"`
- `"Module not found"`
- These mean: **Screenshot it and ask for help**

---

## üíæ WHERE IS YOUR DATA?

Your calendar data is stored in:
- **Supabase** (online database in the cloud)
- It's NOT on your computer
- So you can access it from anywhere
- Your data is safe even if your computer breaks

**Database Address:** `https://xftiwouxpefchwoxxgpf.supabase.co`

---

## üîê IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE

The `.env.local` file contains your database password.

**DO NOT:**
- ‚ùå Share this file with anyone
- ‚ùå Post screenshots showing it
- ‚ùå Upload it to GitHub
- ‚ùå Email it to yourself

**If you accidentally expose it:**
1. Go to Supabase dashboard
2. Generate a new API key
3. Update your `.env.local` file
4. Tell me - I'll help you update it

---

## üìû WHEN TO ASK FOR HELP

**Ask immediately if:**
- The app won't start after following all steps
- You see red ERROR messages
- The calendar shows no data
- Something that worked yesterday doesn't work today

**Don't worry about:**
- Yellow warning messages
- Slow loading the first time
- Terminal text looks scary (that's normal!)

---

## üéì UNDERSTANDING THE TERMINAL

Think of the terminal like this:
- **Terminal** = A way to give your computer typed instructions
- **npm** = A tool that manages your app's pieces
- **start** = The command to run your app
- **localhost** = Your computer's "address" for running apps locally
- **3000** = The specific "door number" your app uses

You don't need to memorize any of this - just follow the steps!

**Next Steps After Starting:**
Once your app loads, check out: `MONTHLY_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md` (I'll create this next) for how to actually USE your calendar system.
