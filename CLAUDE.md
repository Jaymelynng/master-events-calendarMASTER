# CLAUDE.md - AI Session Quick-Start Guide

**Purpose:** Get any AI agent up to speed in under 2 minutes, every session.

---

## 🚨 MANDATORY FIRST STEPS (Do these BEFORE any work)

1. **Read `AI_RULES_READ_FIRST.md`** — Critical rules, system architecture, validation logic
2. **Read `docs/OPERATIONS/CURRENT_SYSTEM_STATUS.md`** — What's working NOW
3. **Read `docs/OPERATIONS/AI_VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL.md`** — NEVER say "it should work"

## 📋 PROJECT SUMMARY (30-second version)

**What:** Team Calendar app for 10 gymnastics gyms — syncs events from iClassPro portals, validates data quality, displays on calendar.

**Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** React 18 + Tailwind CSS → deployed on Vercel
- **Backend:** Flask + Playwright (Python) → deployed on Railway
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Live URL:** https://teamcalendar.mygymtools.com

**User:** Jayme is a NON-TECHNICAL vibe coder. She communicates through documentation. Read ALL docs before making changes.

## 🔑 KEY CONCEPTS

### Validation System
- **DATA errors** (red) = something is WRONG (mismatch between sources)
- **FORMAT errors** (orange) = something is MISSING (required info not found)
- **Precoded rules** = hardcoded in Python (`f12_collect_and_import.py`)
- **Configurable rules** = per-gym in `gym_valid_values` table in Supabase
- **What gets compared:** See `docs/OPERATIONS/AUDIT_DATA_ERROR_REFERENCE.md` for the complete comparison table

### Pricing
- iClass API does NOT provide prices
- **Camp prices:** `camp_pricing` table (we built this)
- **Other prices:** `event_pricing` table with `effective_date` support (we built this Feb 2026)
- **Raw pricing data:** `data/gym-pricing-raw/` has iClassPro enterprise pricing for EST + CCP (all 10 gyms collected)

### Rules System (NEW Feb 23, 2026)
- **Unified `rules` table** replaces `gym_valid_values`
- **Rule Wizard** in Gym Rules tab — two flows: Requirement Exception (3 steps) or Validation Rule (5 steps)
- **Rule types:** valid_price, sibling_price, valid_time, program_synonym, requirement_exception, exception
- **Requirement status notes** — click missing status on dashboard to track (In Progress / Late / Excused)

### Email System (NEW Feb 23, 2026)
- **Email Composer** in Admin Dashboard — generate emails for missing events and/or data errors
- **Open in Outlook** — pre-fills To, CC, Subject, Body in Outlook web compose
- **Manager contacts** stored in `gyms` table (manager_name, manager_email)
- Auto-send via Resend or Power Automate planned but not yet configured

### Admin Access
- Level 1: Everyone sees calendar
- Level 2: Shift+Click magic wand → Admin Dashboard
- Level 3: Press `*` + PIN `1426` → Super Admin (Quick Actions)

### Admin Dashboard Tabs (7 tabs + Email button)
- **Audit & Review** — View/filter/dismiss validation errors
- **Pricing** — Manage event_pricing and camp_pricing
- **Gym Rules** — Rule Wizard, permanent/temporary rules, synonyms, exceptions
- **Change History** — Audit log with filters and CSV export
- **Audit Rules** — Reference table of all 48 validation checks, where they live (hardcoded vs database), known gaps
- **Future Plans** — Track planned features, improvements, ideas (add/edit/delete from UI)
- **Quick Actions** — Sync, import, super admin tools

## ⚠️ KNOWN BUGS & GAPS (as of Feb 2026)

| Issue | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Export bug (analytics ignoring filters) | ✅ FIXED | `ExportModal.js` now uses `filteredEvents` consistently |
| Time regex false positives | ✅ FIXED | Pre-cleaning for "$62 a day", "Ages 4-13" patterns |
| Day range false positives | ✅ FIXED | "Monday-Friday", "Monday through Friday" now handled |
| Export showed single Date column | ✅ FIXED | CSV export now includes Start Date and End Date columns for multi-day events |
| Sync All cross-type false deletions | ✅ FIXED | Comparison now filters existing events by checkedTypes to prevent cross-type false deletions |
| Wrong year in DESCRIPTION | ✅ FIXED | Now checks both title AND description for wrong year (first 300 chars) |
| `program_ignore` rule type | ❌ Not built | Can't ignore "open gym" when it's a station name in KNO |
| `EventsDashboard.js` monolithic | ❌ Not migrated | Refactored version exists but `App.js` still imports the monolithic file |
| Special Events | ✅ Skipped | All validation skipped for SPECIAL EVENT type |
| Deleted events auto-archive | ✅ FIXED | `archive_single_event()` function moves to archive on detection |
| includeDeleted flag broken | ✅ FIXED | Now queries events table directly instead of view |
| Audit card counts mismatch | ✅ FIXED | Cards now only count active errors matching current filters |

## 🛠️ BUILD & TEST

```bash
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run build        # Build (CI=false set in package.json)
npm start            # Local dev server on port 3000
npm test             # Run tests
```

**Build currently:** ✅ Succeeds with only ESLint warnings (no errors)

## 🚫 COMMON MISTAKES (Don't repeat these)

1. **Don't say "it should work"** — Test it, then say "I tested it and it works"
2. **Don't skip reading docs** — Jayme spent hours writing them. Read them.
3. **Don't hardcode values** — Use `gym_valid_values` table for per-gym rules
4. **Don't assume price comes from iClass** — It doesn't. Check pricing tables.
5. **Don't make changes without understanding the full system** — Read docs first
6. **Don't simulate with fake data** — Use actual Supabase data
7. **Don't modify `EventsDashboard.js` without understanding its 4000+ line structure** — It's complex

## 📝 PREVIOUS SESSION LESSONS (from `PREVIOUS CHATS/` folder)

| Chat | Key Lesson |
|------|------------|
| Export feature | Analytics was using `activeEvents` instead of `filteredEvents` — now fixed |
| Export deploy | JSX syntax error in 4000-line file crashed build — be careful with large files |
| Time parsing | Regex `\d{1,2}\s*(a|p)\b` matches "$62 a" and "Ages 4-13" — now pre-cleaned |
| Day parsing | "Monday-Friday" ranges were flagged as day mismatches — now pre-cleaned |
| Copilot rules | ALWAYS search + inspect code before answering. Never assume. |

## 🔄 SESSION WORKFLOW (Follow this every time)

1. **Read this file** (you're doing it now ✅)
2. **Read `AI_RULES_READ_FIRST.md`** for detailed rules
3. **Ask Jayme what she wants to work on**
4. **Read relevant docs** before touching code
5. **Make small changes** — test after each one
6. **Update docs** if you change behavior
7. **Never say "it works" without testing**
