## ⚠️ Reality Check

**What makes this hard:**
- 15+ years of feature development to match
- High switching costs for businesses
- Fragmented small business market
- Need for reliable payment processing

**What makes this possible:**
- Your tool already works
- You understand the problem firsthand
- Niche (multi-gym view) isn't served
- Add-on approach has lower barriers

---

## ✅ Recommended Next Steps

1. **Talk to 5-10 gym owners** - Validate these pain points are real and severe
2. **Define your niche** - Multi-location operators? Parent aggregation?
3. **Start small** - Add-on or specific feature, not full platform
4. **Test pricing** - Would anyone pay? How much?
