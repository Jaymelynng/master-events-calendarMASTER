## Your Next Steps 🚀

### 1. Set Up Environment (5 minutes)

Create your `.env.local` file:

```bash
cp env.example .env.local
```

Then edit `.env.local` and add your Supabase anon key:
```
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=https://xftiwouxpefchwoxxgpf.supabase.co
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-actual-key-here>
```

### 2. Test Locally (2 minutes)

```bash
npm start
```

Should open at http://localhost:3000

### 3. Deploy to Vercel (15 minutes)

Follow the steps in `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`
